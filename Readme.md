### Recipix

Recipix is a mobile application that allows users to take a photo of a handwritten recipe and have that recipe's text detected into a digital save-able format.

The creator of this project had a large album of photos of her grandmother's recipes and didn't want to have to type all of them in by hand in order to have them be readable and accessible.

This project is currently under development.
